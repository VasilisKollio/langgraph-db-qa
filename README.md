# LangGraph SQL Agent 
A Q&A system over a structured database (SQLite) using LangGraph and LLMs to enable natural language querying.

## Workflow Graph
Below is the visual representation of the LangGraph SQL agent workflow:

<img src="files-db/workflow_graph.png" alt="Workflow Graph" width="150"/>

### Instructions
1. Create a python virtual environment
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Go to directory of the files
 `cd files-db`
3. pip install all necessary libraries and python packages
` pip install langgraph langchain langchain-community langchain-core langchain-ollama sqlite3`
4. Run the python script for the .db file you want (This time I have top_detections.db file linked to my script - you can change it by replacing with your own .db file directory)
` python qa_graph.py`

### Architecture

The workflow consists of three main steps:

1. **`write_query`** – Uses an LLM to translate the user's question into SQL.
2. **`execute_query`** – Executes the SQL query on the source database.
3. **`create_temp_db`** – Builds a temporary SQLite database from the results.

These are wired together using `langgraph.StateGraph`.

## Different Databases
Two distinct SQLite databases were used to evaluate the capabilities of the LLM-powered workflow and to test how well the architecture scales with varying data complexity:
### Databases
- `top_detections.db` - A lightweight database containing video camera detection data. It includes a single table with vehicle-related information, useful for querying specific events or segments within surveillance footage.
- `Chinbook-Sqlite.db ` - Music related Database with 11 interrelated tables. Ideal for testing more complex SQL queries and workflows that simulate larger-scale, real-world databases.

### Let's look into the the `top_detection.db` database that interests us more for the time being

### LLM models used for testing (Ollama)
- `codegemma:latest`
- `codellama:latest`
- ` `

### Questions asked & Results
 1. Give me the license plates of the cars that where between the hours of 16:00 and 16:15 and their exact time that they were spotted.
 2. Give me the license plates of every black car.
 Check for any vehicles that were recorded on the traffic_with_busses.mp4 file and give me their license plate number, their vehicle image name and their coordinates on the map.

Temporary database created successfully.

Answer:
Based on the SQL response, there are five vehicles that were recorded on the traffic_with_busses.mp4 file. Their license plate numbers are LM07 MKO, DESG WAX, ETL VVG, ITEM, and there is one vehicle with no license plate number. The vehicle image names are vehicle_34.png, vehicle_35.png, vehicle_39.png, vehicle_40.png, and vehicle_42.png. The coordinates for all five vehicles are 53.478122, -2.186539.

Temporary database created successfully.

Answer:
Based on the SQL response you provided and assuming that the vehicle color is stored in the `vehicle_color` column and the license plate text is stored in the `license_plate_text` column, here are the license plates of every black car:

1. For 'MAE67OS' (black car)
2. For 'WA 96886' (black car)
3. For 'PAV6190' (black car)
4. For '6AE 8658' (black car)
5. For '7C8 8212' (black car)
6. For 'LM07 MKO' (black car)
7. No license plate for black car (None)
9. For 'ETIL VVG' (black car)
10. No license plate for black car (None)

Please note that the SQL response you provided seems to be in a string representation of a Python list of tuples, and it doesn't contain all the data we need to generate this information. However, based on the given schema and question, I can provide an educated guess about the license plates of every black car.
